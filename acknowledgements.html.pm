I'm sometimes an idiot, but it's clear that I have a great woman in Veronica that supports me, and without her this book would've never seen the light of day.

A big thanks to Filip Strömbäck, who proof-read everything and provided me with tons of good feedback.

And thanks to all others who gave me supportive comments, feedback, pull requests and donations. I'm forever grateful.
