In the ◊link[freezing_of_merchant_accounts]{last} two ◊link[undesirable_businesses]{chapters}, we looked at the issues with digital payments, but when you think about donations you wouldn't assume they have the same problems as payments have. For example, when donating money to a charity, like ◊link[charity-water]{Charity Water}, they don't have to be worried about ◊link[charge-back-fraud]{charge back fraud} because you're voluntarily giving them money.◊sn{charity-fees} But the same problem with third-party censorship is relevant here as well.◊sn{voluntary}

Imagine a country doing something really horrible, like ◊link[killing-fields]{purging intellectuals and political opponents}, that would put the government in a bad light. Journalists trying to report on this event may find it difficult or impossible to accept donations to continue their work. A payment processor (which is necessary for digital donations)---perhaps under pressure from the government---might block donations or break the journalist's anonymity,◊sn{crypto-privacy} making donations to truth-seeking journalists very difficult or outright dangerous.

Donations are an excellent use case for cryptocurrencies, as they cannot be censored even by the most powerful nations in the world. And as I'll argue in this chapter, this is a real concern.

◊subhead{A short history of WikiLeaks}

◊link[wikileaks]{WikiLeaks} is a relevant example for illustrating the importance of uncensorable payments as it shows the influence powerful actors have over payment processors and, in turn, the funding for WikiLeaks. We will focus on the Chelsea Manning leaks and the aftermath, where WikiLeaks got their donation channels shut down for exposing government atrocities.

I'll bring up the ◊link[assange-events]{events surrounding Julian Assange}, because they give context and might be relevant to the story of government abuse, but it's not about him or any other person in particular. Even if Julian Assange is guilty of rape, it does not change the importance of the leaks or WikiLeaks as a concept, which goes above individuals.◊mn{association-fallacy}

This is ◊strong{not} a glorification of WikiLeaks---they have ◊link[wikileaks-immoral]{endangered individuals} via their leaks. Instead I hope to show that uncensorable donations are important, because exposing government atrocities can lead to your donations being blocked (and government atrocities should be exposed).

    During Assange's extradition hearing, where the U.K. will rule on extradition to the U.S., Amnesty International were ◊link[amnesty-hearings]{blocked from observing the hearings}. They claim the hearings were intentionally locked down:

    ◊qt{
        The judge wrote back expressing her "regret" at her decision and saying: “I fully recognise that justice should be administered in public". Despite her regret and her recognition that scrutiny is a vital component of open justice, the judge did not change her mind.

        [...]

        Amnesty International have monitored trials from Guantanamo Bay to Bahrain, Ecuador to Turkey. For our observer to be denied access profoundly undermines open justice.
    }

  }

  ◊entry["A farcical extradition hearing"
         #:date "September, 2020"]{

    The human rights activist, Craig Murray, was allowed to observe and he's been documenting the hearing ◊link[craig-murray]{on his blog}, and it's not an exaggeration to call the hearing a farce.

    Witnesses were prevented from taking the stand because the U.S. managed to block any reference to the torture at Guantanamo (which we know is true):

    ◊qt[#:author "Craig Murray"
        #:url day-14
        #:src "Assange Hearing Day 14"]{
        The next witness, Andy Worthington, was at court and ready to give evidence, but was prevented from doing so. The United States government objected to his evidence, about his work on the Guantanamo Detainee files, being heard because it contained allegations of inmates being tortured at Guantanamo.
    }

    In another instance, the prosecution---with the cooperation of the judge---tries to hide the fact that Assange was caught with a razor in the cell, which would imply that Assange is thinking of suicide:

    ◊qt[#:author "Craig Murray"
        #:url day-17
        #:src "Assange Hearing Day 17"
        #:emphasis #t]{
        For Baraitser [the judge] to try to protect both Lewis and the prosecution by pretending the existence of the blade is dependent on the outcome of the subsequent charge, when all three people in the cell at the time of the search agreed to its existence, including Assange, is perhaps Baraitser’s most remarkable abuse of legal procedure yet.

        [...]

        The existence of the blade was not in doubt. Julian Assange had attested to it and two prison warders had attested to it. ◊em{Baraitser said that she could only base her view on the decision of the Prison Governor}.

        [...]

        The Governor’s decision was at paragraph 19. Baraitser told Fitzgerald she could not accept the document as it was new evidence. Fitzgerald told her ◊em{she had herself asked for the outcome of the charge}. He said the document contained very interesting information. Baraitser said that the Governor’s decision was at paragraph 19, that was all she had asked for, and ◊em{she would refuse to take the rest of the document into consideration}.
    }

    The hearing is full of problems like these. The prosecution changed their accusations hours before and the defense not getting enough time to prepare, that the defense was prevented from questioning key witnesses and that there will be no closing speeches in the hearing.

    Nevertheless, in January 2021 the judge ◊link[blocked]{blocked Assange's extradition to the U.S.}

    Not because she disagreed with the prosecution, but because Assange would face barbaric prison treatment in the U.S., and thus it would be "unjust or oppressive to extradite him".

    As of March 2021, the judgement may still be overturned by appeals.

    ◊;As I'm writing this in late September it's not yet decided what will happen to Assange, but it seems clear that the judge already made up her mind before the hearing even began.◊mn{blocked}

◊subhead{Hiding skeletons in the closet}

There's another theme in the WikiLeaks story: How the U.S. government instead of admitting these horrible events, punishing the responsible and making sure they never happen again, seem to do everything to cover them up.

This idea that American soldiers are unconditionally heroes, regardless of what they've done, makes me both angry and sad. Donald Trump has for example expressed concerns over soldiers being prosecuted for war crimes, and ◊link[trump-pardons]{considered pardoning them}. This includes a ◊link[gallagher]{Navy Seals soldier} who (allegedly) killed a 15-year old defenseless kid with his hunting knife and shot unarmed civilians.◊mn{gallagher}

Those aren't the actions of a hero.

◊ndef["gallagher"]{
    The serious charges against the Navy Seal solder ◊link[gallagher-dismissed]{were later dismissed} and he was "only" convicted for posing for a picture with the dead body of the 15-year old.

    Trump continued his support as he announced he was rescinding awards given to some of the Navy prosecutors who brought up the case.

Of course, covering up or rationalizing events isn't a U.S. only phenomena. Here are other examples:

◊ul{
  ◊li{◊link[rel-tiananmen]{As previously mentioned} the Chinese cover up of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.}
  ◊li{How Genghis Khan is looked up to.

  }
  ◊li{In Scandinavian countries we talk about Vikings with pride.

    But the word Viking originally refers to actions of a group: "to viking", "to pirate" or "to pillage". And pillaging means killing, stealing, raping and taking people as slaves. Not unlike the actions of the U.S. soldiers who executed children---which we find so revolting.
  }
  ◊li{How leaders like Ceasar and Kim Jong-il were glorified.

◊ndef["dan-hitler"]{
    Dan Carlin, creator of the excellent ◊link[hardcore-history]{Hardcore History} podcast, brought up an interesting question:

    ◊em{How long will it take for people to celebrate Hitler?}

    It seems absurd to us now, but Genghis Khan did similarly awful things yet there's ◊link[khan-eurovision]{a song in the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest} about him and how "all women fell for him".
}

◊ndef["chernobyl-TV"]{
    I recently finished watching the ◊link[chernobyl-TV]{Chernobyl} TV-series and I think it lives up to the hype. Among other things it captures the feeling of the cover-ups very well.

It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, you can always accept donations digitally via cryptocurrencies. Even the most powerful nations in the world cannot prevent them, which is something unique for cryptocurrencies.

    China does have most of the Bitcoin hashrate inside their country. They could theoretically take majority control of Bitcoin's hashrate and censor transactions that way (this is the worst attack possible against a cryptocurrency, called a ◊def[51%-attack]{51% attack}). If successful this would also completely break Bitcoin's security, making it pointless.

    In this scenario the Bitcoin community would most likely recognize it as an attack and a chain split would happen, making existing miners worthless.
